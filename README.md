# Network Topology Setup

This project will demonstrate how to setup a basic network topology with the assistance of **Cisco Packet Tracer.** 
**Cisco Packet Tracer** is a simulation tool built by Cisco to help educate and train individuals on how to build networks across a multitude of devices.

### Step 1
Set up the Router and two Switches. Then connect them with the Copper-Straight-Through wire connection.

### Step 2
Go to your router settings, click the **Command Line Interface** or **CLI** and input these commands to give your router a host name. In the image below, I named my router **DWR1**

**en/**
**conf t/**
**hostname routername**

The same steps apply for the two Switches as well. It is best to also give them host names to keep it orderly. In this project, I named my Switches **DWSW1** and **DWSW2**

You can also change their display name to match their host names through their respective settings
